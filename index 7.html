    <h1><mark>PHP INFORMATION<mark></h1>
        <P> PHP is a general-purpose scripting language geared towards web development.[8] It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1993 and released in 1995.[9][10] The PHP reference implementation is now produced by the PHP Group.[11] PHP was originally an abbreviation of Personal Home Page,[12][13] but it now stands for the recursive initialism PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor.[14]

            PHP code is usually processed on a web server by a PHP interpreter implemented as a module, a daemon or a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) executable. On a web server, the result of the interpreted and executed PHP code—which may be any type of data, such as generated HTML or binary image data—would form the whole or part of an HTTP response. Various web template systems, web content management systems, and web frameworks exist that can be employed to orchestrate or facilitate the generation of that response. Additionally, 
            PHP can be used for many programming tasks outside the web context, such as standalone graphical applications[15] and robotic drone control.[16] PHP code can also be directly executed from the command line.
            
            The standard PHP interpreter, powered by the Zend Engine, is free software released under the PHP License. PHP has been widely ported and can be deployed on most web servers on a variety of operating systems and platforms.[17]
            
            The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, with the original implementation acting as the de facto standard that other implementations aimed to follow. Since 2014, work has gone on to create a formal PHP specification.[18]
            
            W3Techs reports that as of January 2023, "PHP is used by 77.8% of all the websites whose server-side programming language we know."[19] It also reports that only 8% of PHP users use the currently supported 8.x versions. Most use unsupported PHP 7, more specifically PHP 7.4, while 23% use PHP 5, which is not supported with security fixes and is known to have serious security vulnerabilities. This does not necessarily indicate that these websites are vulnerable, though, since Linux distributions such as Debian provide security patches for unsupported versions of PHP.[20</P>
            <H2> <MARK> HISTORY</MARK></H2>
            <P> PHP development began in 1993[9] when Rasmus Lerdorf wrote several Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs in C,[21][22] which he used to maintain his personal homepage. He extended them to work with web forms and to communicate with databases, and called this implementation "Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter" or PHP/FI.
                PHP/FI could be used to build simple, dynamic web applications. To accelerate bug reporting and improve the code, Lerdorf initially announced the release of PHP/FI as "Personal Home Page Tools (PHP Tools) version 1.0" on the Usenet discussion group comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi on 8 June 1995.[1][23] This release already had the basic functionality that PHP has today. This included Perl-like variables, form handling, and the ability to embed HTML. 
                The syntax resembled that of Perl, but was simpler,[citation needed] more limited[citation needed] and less consistent.[</P>
        <H3><MARK>Installation and configuration </MARK></H3>
        <P> There are two primary ways for adding support for PHP to a web server – as a native web server module, or as a CGI executable. PHP has a direct module interface called server application programming interface (SAPI), which is supported by many web servers including Apache HTTP Server, Microsoft IIS and iPlanet Web Server. Some other web servers, such as OmniHTTPd, support the Internet Server Application Programming Interface (ISAPI), which is Microsoft's web server module interface. If PHP has no module support for a web server, it can always be used as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) or FastCGI processor; in that case, the web server is configured to use PHP's CGI executable to process all requests to PHP files.[245]

            PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is an alternative FastCGI implementation for PHP, bundled with the official PHP distribution since version 5.3.3.[246] When compared to the older FastCGI implementation, it contains some additional features, mostly useful for heavily loaded web servers.[247]
            
            When using PHP for command-line scripting, a PHP command-line interface (CLI) executable is needed. PHP supports a CLI server application programming interface (SAPI) since PHP 4.3.0.[248] The main focus of this SAPI is developing shell applications using PHP. There are quite a few differences between the CLI SAPI and other SAPIs, although they do share many of the same behaviours.[249]
            
            PHP has a direct module interface called SAPI for different web servers;[250] in case of PHP 5 and Apache 2.0 on Windows, it is provided in form of a DLL file called php5apache2.dll,[251] which is a module that, among other functions, provides an interface between PHP and the web server, implemented in a form that the server understands. This form is what is known as a SAPI.
            
            There are different kinds of SAPIs for various web server extensions. For example, in addition to those listed above, other SAPIs for the PHP language include the Common Gateway Interface and command-line interface.[250][252]
            
            PHP can also be used for writing desktop graphical user interface (GUI) applications, by using the PHP-GTK extension. PHP-GTK is not included in the official PHP distribution,[245] and as an extension, it can be used only with PHP versions 5.1.0 and newer. The most common way of installing PHP-GTK is by compiling it from the source code.[253]
            
            When PHP is installed and used in cloud environments, software development kits (SDKs) are provided for using cloud-specific features. For example:
            
            Amazon Web Services provides the AWS SDK for PHP[254]
            Microsoft Azure can be used with the Windows Azure SDK for PHP.[255]
            Numerous configuration options are supported, affecting both core PHP features and extensions.[256][257] Configuration file php.ini is searched for in different locations, depending on the way PHP is used.[258] The configuration file is split into various sections,[259] while some of the configuration options can be also set within the web server configuration.</P>
